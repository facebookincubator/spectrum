title: About Spectrum
---

Spectrum is a cross-platform image transcoding library. It can easily be integrated into an Android/iOS project and it is designed to efficiently perform image operations on mobile platforms.

By depending directly on low level codecs libraries Spectrum has the ability of controlling and surfacing some options that are not typically exposed by platform frameworks. For example, some JPEG-to-JPEG operations such as cropping can be executed lossless. Another example is disabling chroma sub-sampling for better quality when saving graphical images as JPEG.

The API of Spectrum incorporates declarative traits. This simplifies the usage for the developer by focussing on the desired outcome. At the same time it enables Spectrum to transparently choose the best execution sequence.
